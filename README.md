# LiftingLog

This iOS app is the capstone project for the [Ray Wenderlich iOS Bootcamp](https://www.raywenderlich.com/10408731-rw-bootcamp).

It is a workout tracker specifically designed for powerlifting. You can record workouts with different exercises (in the standard sets x reps x weight format).

It is using a basic custom backend API [LiftingLog-VaporBackend](https://github.com/tssandor/LiftingLog-VaporBackend), so it can also display how much weight the community has moved so far. Let's hope it adds up quickly :]

The code is not perfect, obviously! Pull requests are welcome :]

*Enjoy!*
